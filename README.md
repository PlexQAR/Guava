# Project Guava

This project involves the simulation and analysis of nuclear reactors, including a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) and a Transmutation Power Reactor (TPR). OpenMC, a Monte Carlo-based nuclear reactor simulation code, is the primary tool used for these simulations.

The repository holds:

    Test data
    Simulation scripts
    Voxel plots
    Visualization tools (e.g., VTK for 3D representations)
    XML Data Files

The Transmutation Power Reactor (TPR) was developed by PQAR (https://www.pqar.net/) for research testing and has not been created in real life. Project Guava aims to test a TPR's reliability in a real-working environment.
